# Deploy ARM Template with the Azure Portal #

## Challenge ##
You can create PaaS or IaaS services in Azure by adding and configure them in the Azure Portal. This is fine for one-time creation. But when you need to create the same environment multiple times it’s error-prone and time consuming. Let’s automate this repeating work.

In this challenge, you will use Azure and ARM templates to provision PaaS services to Azure. This will involve logging into the Azure Portal, select an ARM template and execute the ARM template from a website.
